Hurricane Hattie was the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclone of the 1961
Atlantic hurricane season, reaching a peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane.
The ninth tropical storm and seventh hurricane and major hurricane of the season,
Hattie originated from an area of low pressure that strengthened into a tropical
storm over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 27. Moving generally northward,
the storm quickly became a hurricane and later major hurricane the following day. Hattie
then turned westward west of Jamaica and strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane, with
maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 km/h). It weakened to Category 4 before making landfall
south of Belize City on October 31. The storm turned southwestward and weakened rapidly over the
mountainous terrain of Central America, dissipating on November 1.

 sustained the worst damage from the hurricane.[nb 1] The former capital, Belize City, was buffeted by
